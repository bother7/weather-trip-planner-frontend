# Weather Trip Planner

Weather Trip Planner is a app designed to help travels make decisions based on the weather in the area that they're traveling to. It provides a forecast 10 days in advance to provide suggestions on what events are on meetup depending on the weather conditions. Currently, it only allows for one trip at a time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Must have npm installed, this app was made with version 5.4.2, node version v6.11.2

### Installing

Make sure that you also set up the rails backend: https://github.com/LinKCoding/weather-trip-planner-backend.

Then:
```
$ yarn add
$ yarn start
```
Note: if you're also running the rails server locally there can be a conflict of ports. You can start the rails server first and let yarn take care of selecting another port or manually change it for either the rails server or for this app.
